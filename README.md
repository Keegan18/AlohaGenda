	/* 
	And in the death,
	As the last few corpses lay rotting on the slimy
	Thoroughfare,
	The shutters lifted in inches in Temperance Building,
	High on Poacher's Hill.
	And red, mutant, eyes gaze down on Hunger City.
	No more big wheels.
	Fleas the size of rats sucked on rats the size of cats,
	And ten thousand peoploids split into small tribes,
	Coveting the highest of the sterile skyscrapers,
	Like packs of dogs assaulting the glass fronts of Love-Me Avenue.
	Ripping and rewrapping mink and shiny silver fox, now leg-warmers.
	Family badge of sapphire and cracked emerald.
	Any day now,
	The year of the Diamond Dogs.
